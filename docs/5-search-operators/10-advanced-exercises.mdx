## Promote shorter books

You've noticed that readers tend to prefer shorter books. Without using a large score boost, try to promote shorter books in the search results.

:::tip
Even without a score adjuster, the [`should`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-search/compound/#mongodb-data-should) operator will still boost the score of the documents that match it.

Choose your favourite method to build aggregation pipelines and try to solve the following exercises.

## Most available book of the month books

Build a search aggregation stage that will promote the books of the month, and will return the books with the most copies available first.

## Most prolific pooh author

Find out which author has written the most books that contains the word "pooh" (we're talking about the bear here) in the title or in the synopsis.

## Assume typos, but still find the matches

Find books that match a user query, but also return books that match with a typo. These books should be returned after the books that match the query.
