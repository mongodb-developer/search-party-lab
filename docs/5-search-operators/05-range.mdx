# 📘 The `range` operator

The `range` operator is similar to `equals`, but works on ranges of values.

The `range` operator has the following syntax. You can find more explanation about it in the <Link to="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-search/range/">documentation</Link>.

```js
{
   "$search": {
      "index": <index name>, // optional, defaults to "default"
      "range": {
         "path": "<field-to-search>",
         "gt | gte": <value-to-search>,
         "lt | lte": <value-to-search>,
         "score": <score-options>
      }
   }
}
```

This could be useful if you wanted to query only for books that have a range of pages. Say you only want books between 100 and 300 pages, you could use the `range` operator to refine your results.
