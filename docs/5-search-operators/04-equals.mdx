# The `equals` operator

The `equals` operator is used to search for a specific value in a field. It is similar to the `match` operator, but the operation will be performed by Lucene, and can be combined with other operators to refine results.

The `equals` operator has the following syntax. You can find more explanation about it in the <Link to="">documentation</Link>.

```js
{
   $search: {
      "index": <index name>, // optional, defaults to "default"
      "equals": {
         "path": "<field-to-search>",
         "value": <boolean-value>|<objectId>|<number>|<date>,
         "score": <score-options>
      }
   }
}
```

This could be useful if you wanted to query only for books that were published in a specific year.
