# 🦸 Intro to facets

A facet is a way to group documents together based on a common value.  For example, if you have a list of movies, you might want to group them by genre. You could then use the facet to filter the results to only show movies of a certain genre.

A common use case is to use facets to create a filter. You can see this in most e-commerce sites. For example, you will see a list of categories on the left side of the page, and each category will have a number next to it. This number represents the number of products in that category.

            "lte": 2015
          }
