# Aggregation Pipelines

MongoDB provides some advanced operators to query data, but if you want to build complex queries, similar to `JOIN` and `GROUP BY` in SQL, you need to use the aggregation pipeline framework.

## Intro

The aggregation pipeline is a framework for data aggregation modeled on the concept of data processing pipelines. Documents enter a multi-stage pipeline that transforms the documents into an aggregated result.

The most basic pipeline stages provide filters that operate like queries and document transformations that modify the form of the output document.

Other pipeline operations provide tools for grouping and sorting documents by specific fields as well as tools for aggregating the contents of arrays, including arrays of documents. The pipeline provides efficient data aggregation using native operations within MongoDB and is the preferred method for data aggregation in MongoDB.

## Pipeline Stages

A pipeline consists of a sequence of stages. Each stage transforms the documents as they pass through the pipeline. Pipeline stages do not need to produce one output document for every input document; e.g., some stages may generate new documents or filter out documents.

Pipeline stages can appear multiple times in the pipeline. Certain pipeline operators can also appear multiple times: for example, you can have multiple `$match` stages in a pipeline.

The documents travel through the stages in sequence. The first stage receives the entire input and the last stage emits the entire output as documents.

Some of the common pipeline stages are:
* `$match` - filters documents
* `$group` - groups documents by some expression
* `$sort` - sorts documents
* `$limit` - limits the number of documents

## Building aggregation pipelines in the Atlas UI

You can build aggregation pipelines in the Atlas UI using the Aggregation Pipeline Builder. The Aggregation Pipeline Builder provides a graphical interface for building aggregation pipelines.

In the Atlas UI, go to the Database navigation link. You will see the cluster you created earlier. From there click `Browse Collections`.

This will bring you to the collections view. Click on the `movies` collection to see the matching documents.

:::note
Just above the documents, you will see an input box that says _Type a query_. Here, you can type in a query exactly like you used with the `find` method.

Click on the _Aggregation_ tab at the top. This will bring you to the Aggregation Pipeline Builder.

From here, let's create a simple aggregation that will return the title, and IMDB rating of the three longest comedies.

First, add a stage to `$match` all comedies.

```js
{
  genres: "Comedy"
}
```

Next, use a `$sort` stage to sort the players by their overall score.

```js
{
  runtime: -1
}
```

Use a `$limit` stage to limit the results to the top three players.

```js
3
```

Finally, use a `$project` stage to return only the wanted fields.

```js
{
  title: 1,
  "imdb.rating": 1,
  runtime: 1,
  genres: 1
}
```

This will return a new collection of documents with the three longest comedies.
