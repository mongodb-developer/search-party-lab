# üëê Add Semantic Search to Your Application

You now know everything you need to add vector search capabilities to your application.

## Configuring the environment variables

In your `server/.env` [file](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/library-management-system/blob/main/server/.env), you'll find a few variables that you can use to configure the application. Add a couple more at the end of the file to configure the embeddings source and the API key.

```json
EMBEDDINGS_SOURCE=serverlessEndpoint
EMBEDDING_KEY=<API Key>
```

:::tip
Your instructor will provide you with an API key that you can use for the event you're attending. Set it in the `EMBEDDING_KEY` variable.
:::

## Configuring the vector search query

Open up the code from the server [file](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/library-management-system/blob/main/server/src/controllers/books.ts) `server/src/controllers/books.ts` once more, and edit the `searchBooks` method to query your data for semantic search.

:::tip
Use the `getEmbeddings` function to convert the query into a vector.

```js
public async searchBooks(query: string): Promise<Book[]> {
  const vector = await getEmbeddings(query);
  const aggregationPipeline = [
    {
      $vectorSearch: {
        queryVector:  vector,
        path: 'embeddings',
        numCandidates: 100,
        index: 'vectorsearch',
        limit: 10,
      }
    }
  ];
  const books = await collections?.books?.aggregate(aggregationPipeline).toArray() as Book[];
  return books;
}

```
</div>
</details>

## Testing the semantic search

To test the semantic search in the app, try to search for some books but use different words that have a similar meaning or are related to the book's cover.

You can use the following queries:
- Canines doing stuff
- Fluffy animals
- European history
