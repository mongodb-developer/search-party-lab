You can observe the effect of hybrid search on the search results by tuning the **VECTOR_WEIGHT** and **FULL_TEXT_WEIGHT**.
Lets use the search term ***basketball*** and compare the results. Note that your results may look different as we may periodically make changes to the dataaset.

Lets start with setting `VECTOR_WEIGHT=0` and `FULL_TEXT_WEIGHT=1` i.e. the results will be based on 100% full-text search.

<details>
<summary>Here are the top 5 titles:</summary>
<div>
1. The New York Knicks Basketball Team (Great Sports Teams)
2. In the Land of Giants: My Life in Basketball
3. Venus to the Hoop: A Gold Medal Year in Women's Basketball
4. Night Hoops
5. Cat (Fear Street Series #45)
</div>
</details>

Now, lets set `VECTOR_WEIGHT=1` and `FULL_TEXT_WEIGHT=0` i.e. the results will be based on 100% vector search.

<details>
<summary>Here are the top 5 titles:</summary>
<div>
1. NBA: The Official Fan's Guide
2. In the Land of Giants: My Life in Basketball
3. Night Hoops
4. Venus to the Hoop: A Gold Medal Year in Women's Basketball
5. The Big Three
</div>
</details>

Finally, lets set `VECTOR_WEIGHT=0.5` and `FULL_TEXT_WEIGHT=0.5` i.e. we are placing equal empahasis on full-text search and vector search.

<details>
<summary>Here are the top 5 titles:</summary>
<div>
1. In the Land of Giants: My Life in Basketball
2. Venus to the Hoop: A Gold Medal Year in Women's Basketball
3. Night Hoops
4. The New York Knicks Basketball Team (Great Sports Teams)
5. NBA: The Official Fan's Guide
</div>
</details>

**Key observations:**
1. From the full-text search result, **Cat (Fear Street Series #45)** can be seen as a false positive because it may have little to do with basketball but it is only there because the synopsis contains the word **basketball**.
2. From the vector search result, **The Big Three** made it to the top 5 because it showed a few basketball players on its cover image, but this title was missed in the full-text search because neither the title nor the synopsis contains the word **basketball**.
3. From the hybrid search result, titles that made it to both types of search were ranked higher
